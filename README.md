# The Lost Island

[Live site](https://git.heroku.com/lost-island.git)
## Introduction
This is a text-based adventure game.

The game invites the user to an exciting interactive story, where the user's different choices controls the direction of the story.

## Data Model
### Flowchart
I used a flowchart from [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning)
to map out how I envisioned the logic of the game. This flowchart is a basis for the most important functions and directions of the game. therefore, the number of scenes may differ from the final result.

### Imports
I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

* <mark style="background:pink">sys</mark>: used for the restart() and print_slow() functions.
* <mark style="background:pink">os</mark>: used for the clear() function.
* <mark style="background:pink">time</mark>: used for time.sleep()function.
* <mark style="background:pink">pyfiglet</mark>: used for including the ASCII art.
* <mark style="background:pink">colorama</mark>: used for including colors.
